    "title": "🔥 Generative UI: The Future of Frontend (And Why You Should Care) - DevConf.CZ 2025",
    "description": "Speaker(s): Daniel Ostrovsky\n\nThis talk is all about Generative UI. AI-driven user interfaces that actually adapt to users in real time. No more static, one-size-fits-all UIs. We’re talking about apps that think, respond, and evolve based on what users need.\n\nBut here’s the catch: if you’re still building UIs like it’s 2020, you might be in trouble. We’ll dig into why modular designs (like Micro-Frontends) are the key to making AI-ready web apps, what skills frontend devs need to pick up right now, and how to work with AI instead of getting left behind.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/schedule/",

    "description": "The micro-frontend architecture is attracting more and more developers, and module federation is a great addition to this architectural pattern. And as with any new technology, new questions are raised. \n\nLet's take real-life examples and live coding to answer the following but not limited to: how we should divide apps and whether there are specific criteria to separate them. \n\nIs my project suitable for the Micro-Frontend at all? When should I use Micro-Frontend and when Module Federation? And some other questions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Angular Tiny Conf\n\nAngular is the beloved framework to thousands of developers around the world and has lately been moving at a very fast pace.\n\nThe Angular Tiny Conference is a quarterly one-day online event aiming to share all of the amazing ways individuals and teams are using not only the latest and greatest features, but also to celebrate the hard-won victories as a testimony to the longevity and health of the platform.\n\nFind out more at: https://angulartinyconf.com\n\nThank you to our sponsor Techlabs 28 (https://techlabs28.com) your premier provider for full stack Angular applications.

Michael Hladky!!\n\nDaniel Ostrovsky\nFull-Stuck RunTime type validation\n---------\nHow to ensure type validation of data coming from external sources? \n\n“Runtime boundaries type validation” or “full stuck type-safe”, - all this talking about the ability to validate types of data coming from external sources. It can be any API or WebHook Call, third-part form validation, DB queries results or file content (such as JSON or CSV). Let’s see how can we define runtime types for the expected data, that can be validated while the application is running, to create a smooth developer experience with strong assurances of correctness at build-time.\n\n\nMichael Hladky\nFully Zone-Less - High-Performance Angular applications in post IVY\n---------\nThe async pipe is boring! \n\nUnderstand the guts of Angulars change detection and why zone.js is your biggest enemy.\nLearn the trick on template bindings, component rendering, and where you pay the biggest price.\n\nAs the tip of the iceberg, you will learn how to identify and avoid blocking UIs by analyzing flame charts and leverage task scheduling.\n\nIn the end, you will be able to build applications with zone-less performance even in a zone-full environment. \n\n\nNir Kaufman\n15 minutes of Angular - Patterns & Techniques\n---------\nLet's learn something new! Each session I will dive into an Angular feature, technique, or API. I'll focus on understanding the problem, and how to come up with a practical solution - the Angular way :)\nTips and best-practices included.\n\n\nAt the end of the meetup we will raffle 2 Jetbrains Licenses and a free ticket to AngularUP!",

At the same time is one of the most life-changing features. Once you get it your life will never be the same. We will start from basics definitions and go all the way to advanced real-life examples and use cases.\n\nDecorators are incredibly cool. They allow you to describe meta data directly in the class declaration, grouping everything in one place and avoiding duplication. Terribly addictive. Once having tried, you will use it forever However the decorators in TypeScript are not as simple as we would like. Working with them requires some skills.\nIn this talk we will try to cover:\nPrologue\nDecorators in TC39 stage 2. meaning and when to expect.\nBabel\nFrameworks uses decorators (Angular, NestJS, MobiX…)\nIntro\nDescriptor and why it’s matter\nSimple logger decorator (live-coding)\nMethod decorator\nRun time\nValidators (live-coding)\nmemoize (livecoding)\nMethod’s param decorator\nWhy it’s so cool\nReal life examples (livecoding)\nClass Decorators (livecoding)\nClass Composition\nClass mixing\nAdvances (optionally)\nReflection, metadata\nUse cases and examples (livecoding)\nA coding is worth a thousand words….",
